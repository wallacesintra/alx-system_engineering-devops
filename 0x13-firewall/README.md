# Firewall

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary purpose is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

## Key functions of a firewall

1. Packet Filtering:  Examining packets of data entering or leaving a network and accepting or rejecting them based on predetermined criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, or protocols.

2. Stateful Inspection: Tracking the state of active connections and only allowing packets that are part of established and legitimate connections to pass through.

3. Proxy Service: Acting as an intermediary for connections between internal and external systems, which helps to hide the internal network structure.

4. Application Layer Filtering: Providing more detailed inspection of data packets at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model), which allows for more granular control over specific types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
